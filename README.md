# Recipe_Finder_Website
This codes enables a recipe finder functionality using the MealDB API. It captures user input from a search bar, fetches recipe details based on the entered dish name, and dynamically displays the results. If the input field is empty, an error message is shown. Upon a successful API response, it extracts and displays the mealâ€™s image, name, origin, ingredients, and cooking instructions. The script also generates a list of ingredients with measurements. If the dish is not found, an error message is displayed.
